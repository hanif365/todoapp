## Project Name: Todo App

[Project Live Link](https://todoapp01.vercel.app)

## Overview:
A simple, efficient Todo List application where we use Zustand for state management with local storage for data persistence.

## Key Features:

1. **Play with Task:**
    - User can add tasks, edit task, and delete task into the system.
    - User can also set priority when they create a task. They also change their priority after task created.

2. **Priority based color select:**
    - For low, medium, and high priority tasks, we set task's background color green, yellow and green. so that we can easily find task based on our priority.
    - High priority tasks shows upper of the list, then medium, and then low.

3. **Shows total task and completed tasks:**
    - We show total tasks and completed tasks, so that user can get an idea about their task.

4. **Zustand: State Management Library:**
    - We use zustand for manage our state. It's make our application super simple.

5. **Persists our Data:**
    - We use persists middleware of zustand, which persists our data using local storage.


## Upcoming Features:
1. **User can search their task**
    - For maany task it's hard to find their task, so that we will implement search facilities near soon (InshaAllah).
